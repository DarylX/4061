just got it to read files, it says there will be a maximum of 1024 characters so we shouldnt have to worry about files that are too large. If you can, it would really help if you put all the functions and prototypes in different files so we only have to worry about 1 file where we can figure out the logic; it would be less cluttered and easier to read if we had multiple files. just the assignment1 functions, everything except main. Im gonna begin working on parsing the input into nodes and then we can finally put the nodes together and make them do stuff and things.kthxbai
